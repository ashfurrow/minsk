Mobile Developer & Business Day
================

Here's an (annotated) version of the playground I used in my [Mobile Developer & Business Day](http://by.mdday.ru/) presentation on functional programming in Swift.  Slides are based on those available [here](https://speakerdeck.com/ashfurrow/the-future-of-functional-programming-on-ios).

Thanks to [Cyril Lashkevich](http://github.com/notorca) for making an [Objective-C version](https://gist.github.com/notorca/29bb305d08d6fb5a8f84). 

Many thanks to [Jason Sandmeyer](https://github.com/jas) for his [Swift Playground Builder](https://github.com/jas/swift-playground-builder).
